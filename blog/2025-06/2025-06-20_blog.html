  <h1>Restarting "0.15 Tons of Me" – June 20, 2025</h1>
  <p><em>by Mr.Null</em></p>

  <p>Recently, I’ve finally established a solid structure for logging and observing my body.<br>
  Starting today, June 20, 2025, I’m officially launching a dual-track system:<br>
  <strong>Markdown logs in Japanese (for private use)</strong> and <strong>HTML logs in English (for public viewing)</strong>.</p>

  <h2>🔧 What’s been set up so far</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Daily separation and formatting of body composition and meal logs</li>
    <li>GitHub repository restructured to completely separate private (<code>originals/</code>) and public (<code>logs/</code>) data</li>
    <li><strong>HTML logs are published in English only</strong>, while Markdown files are for detailed internal archiving</li>
    <li>Top page, favicon, and index auto-generation also completed</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧠 What this log is really about</h2>
  <p>This isn’t just a weight-loss journal.<br>
  It’s a quiet document of change — physical shifts, thought fragments, emotional ripples, and day-to-day meals and motion.</p>

  <p>This space is <strong>not for teaching or showing off</strong>.<br>
  It’s for quiet recording, a little laughter, and gentle re-alignment.<br>
  That’s all.</p>

  <h2>🌐 Publishing rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Only four indicators are publicly shared: weight, body fat %, fat-free mass, and skeletal muscle mass</li>
    <li>Meals are summarized briefly; any narrative or introspection is expressed in English</li>
    <li><strong>No feedback. No replies. Just observation.</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎙️ Finally</h2>
  <p>If you happened to stumble upon this log, please just observe in silence.<br>
  This is a mirror reflecting the weight, will, and days of a single person.</p>

  <p>Observation begins.</p>

  <p>– Mr.Null</p>
