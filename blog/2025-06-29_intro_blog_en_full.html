  <h1>üåÄ Welcome ‚Äì About This Blog</h1>

  <p>First of all, thank you for visiting this blog.<br>
  Allow me to begin with a brief introduction and share the purpose behind starting this site.<br>
  It may be a bit long, but I hope you'll read to the end‚Äîbecause this will likely be a long journey together.</p>

  <p>My name is <strong>Mr. Null</strong>, a 54-year-old man who weighs 330 pounds (about 150 kilograms)‚Äîa rather extraordinary body size, as the blog title suggests.</p>

  <p>I've gone through many cycles of intentional weight loss and gain over the years, making me something of a <em>‚Äúsuper dieter‚Äù</em> (with a laugh). In my younger years, I also had phases of being a semi-serious trainee.<br>
  Roughly estimated, the total weight I've lost and regained probably exceeds <strong>500 kilograms (over 1000 pounds)</strong>.</p>

  <p>Through this long, winding experience, I‚Äôve absorbed a great deal across various fields‚Äîmedicine, physiology, biomechanics, food science, and bioengineering.<br>
  But above all, what matters most is the <strong>act of observing myself</strong>‚Äîliving in this body and documenting its journey.</p>

  <p>I also live with a <strong>visual impairment</strong>, which makes the act of observation a daily discipline in the truest sense.<br>
  This blog is my personal <strong>Observation Log</strong>, a tool to understand myself better‚Äîand hopefully, it may offer encouragement or insight to others facing similar bodily challenges.</p>

  <p>The blog is built around two main components:<br>
  <ul>
    <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Daily observation logs</strong> (tracking body composition, meals, and physical condition)</li>
    <li>‚Ä¢ <strong>Occasional essays</strong> reflecting on deeper thoughts and physical awareness</li>
  </ul></p>

  <p>The former serves as a quantitative record, while the latter captures qualitative shifts in my perception.
  I hope both can contribute to improving <strong>quality of life (QOL)</strong> and extending our healthy lifespans.</p>

  <p>One important thing to note: <strong>This is a one-way communication space</strong>.<br>
  There are no "likes", comments, or social feedback.<br>
  Rather than seeking connection with others, I focus on connecting <strong>with myself</strong>, and <strong>opening that process</strong> for others to observe‚Äîif they wish.</p>

  <p>You are welcome to quote or share links to this blog freely.<br>
  However, <strong>I bear no responsibility for any consequences or troubles</strong> that may arise from doing so.<br>
  This blog is not meant to instruct anyone, nor to prove anything right or wrong. It is simply a personal record, written for myself.</p>

  <p>Still, if you happen to find a thought, word, or insight within these pages that resonates with your own life‚Äîplease feel free to take it with you.</p>

  <p>Thank you for reading, and I hope we can continue this journey together.</p>
